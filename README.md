# Code to implement HIL simulation on a National Instruments FPGA platform
The presented codes were generated in LabView 2019.

To run and load the VI "HIL_Boost_PVP-HT.vi" it must be included in the project and executed in the FPGA layer of your NI equipment.

The controls "Boost.ctl inputs" and "Boost_pvp_Vd.ctl states" must also be included in the FPGA layer in case you want to modify them or generate some array to extract the HIL simulation data.
